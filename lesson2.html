<H2> Links </H2>

<P> Links can be added using "a" tags. Anything that appears between the opening and closing "a" tags is the part that will become a clickable link on the web page. "a" is short for anchor.</P>

<H2> HTML Attributes </H2>
<p>Attributes are written inside an open tag, the attribute is written followed by the attribute value, this can be another link in this case, for example the href tag.</p>
<p> The Href tag is a html attribute which can set what page should open when the link is clicked. an example of it in use can be ([a href = "the web site url"]) followed by a close tag. It's important that the url is always put in quote marks. </p>
<p> HTML attributes let you add additional features or information to a tag beyond just the tag name and text content </p>

  <H3> Target attribute </H3>
  <p>The Target tag can be used to set where the page you set in the hred should open when the link is clicked.</p>
  <p>An example of a Target Tag in use is the {_blank} target tag. This _blank means the link will open in a new tab or window. </p>
  <p>Another example is the {_self} tag, the current open page will be replaced with the new tab. This is the default attribute anyway. </p>

<H2> Absolute vs Relative paths </H2>
<P> Absolute paths ask for a specific file from a specific server. Absolute files always include the http protocol and the server e.g httmp://example/com, this is not always the best usecase.</p>
<P> Relative paths ask for a file with no server specified. This can look like the following: [<a href = " example . html "> example page ].</p>
<p> Since there is no protocol or server included in this path, the browser assumes you mean the same server that your page is on. </p>

<p> Relative links should almost always be used when linking to pages that are located on the same site. </p>
<p> Absolute links should always be used when linking to pages outside of the server. </p>
